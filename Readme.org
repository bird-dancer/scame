* philosophy
simple "performant" GNU Emacs 30+ [[https://leanpub.com/lit-config/read][literate config]] that uses as much built in stuff as possible and builds upon that where necessary

unless you load external-packages.el only built in emacs functions will be used, leading to a very responsive but powerfull experience

#+begin_example
S imple       -  easy to use and read, itâ€™s just setting varaibles and calling functions
C onfigurable -  everything can be overwritten
A greeable    -  settings that are up to taste (e.g. font, theme) are left for the user to configure
M odular      -  functionality is split up into different files, that can be loaded separatly from each other
E macs        -  you know what it is
#+end_example

* how to use
clone the package and put this in the beginning of your init.el

All configurations in [[file:Base.org][base]] do not include external packages and are only using emacs 30 built in functionality.
If you want to extend Emacs' functionality even further you can include the [[file:Extended.org][extended]] configurations.

** base
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (load "~/scame/base.el" nil t)
#+end_src

you can also just load individual modules. they are named the same as the first level headings in this file e.g.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (load "~/scame/base/keybindings.el" nil t)
#+end_src

** extended
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (load "~/scame/extended.el" nil t)
#+end_src

or for only packages focused on specific functionality use e.g:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (load "~/scame/extended/buffer-completion-system.el" nil t)
#+end_src

** example config
this is what my Emacs config looks like:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (load "~/scame/base.el" nil t)
  (load "~/scame/extended.el" nil t)

  (set-frame-font "Comic Shanns Mono 14" nil t)
  (load-theme 'modus-operandi-tinted)

  (setq user-full-name "Felix Dumbeck"
        user-mail-address "felix@dumbeck.net")

  (setq org-agenda-files
        '("~/uni/notes/uni.org"
          "~/uni/notes/personal.org"))

  (bind-key "C-z" #'yank)
#+end_src

* requirements
For [[base]] only GNU Emacs 30.1+ is required.
